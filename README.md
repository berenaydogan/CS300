This repository contains the homework assignments for CS300 Data Structures at SabancÄ± University. This course provided an in-depth understanding of essential techniques in algorithm analysis and data structures. We began with a comprehensive exploration of algorithm efficiency, focusing on concepts like time and space complexity and Big O notation. The course covered many data structures, including linked lists, queues, stacks, hash tables, disjoint sets, binary heaps, trees, and graphs. Each structure was thoroughly examined, covering its types, operations, properties, and practical applications. Additionally, we delved into sorting algorithms and graph-related algorithms. All these data structures and algorithms were implemented in C++ and applied to solve real-world problems. This repository contains all the homework assignments I've completed as part of the coursework.
